# fyre.gg

The idea of fyre.gg is to provide on demand and indepth player statistics for the game League of Legends.  The game boasts a player base of hundreds of millions of players world wide and is considered to be one of the most popular games in the world.  Below is a gif of the site in action locally.  

Video demo of current build (**Due to the amount of images needed for every champ, item, spell hosting on a free version of Heroku is not an option due to size.**)

*Current features*
 - Search Riot DB for match statistics on specific players.  Defaults to five most recent matches pulling kills/assists/deaths, items and match duration and creation times.  Build profile page with dynamic photos and tooltips of items, spells and calculations of relevant statistics just as Kill/Death Ratio and Creep Score.  Currently only allows for NA region but API routing built out to dyanmically allow for searching in 16 regions in the future.
 - Pull statistics on specific matches and pull data on all ten players included in the game similar to the profile pages.
 - Built out DB caching in order to allow for rate limiting.  API checks DB for cached profiles and matches prior hit Riot API for profile/match statistics.  Profile page has built out update profile button which allows user to manually refresh statistics to most recent matches.

 *Future features*
 - **Needs serious improvements to optimization.**  Need to consider moving certain operations to backend as so many functions, data parsing etc. is front-end loaded.  Many operations will have to be hidden behind loaders which is messer than trying to improve speed.
  - Figure out API server hosting and moving away from a monolithic app and look into spliting front end and back end.  **Due to the amount of images needed for every champ, item, spell hosting on a free version of Heroku is not an option due to size.**  
 - Dyanmically allow for different regions to be searched through.  Currently statically built out for NA only.
 - More in depth pages for Champions, Items and Spells beyond just dyanimically rendered photos and tooltips.
 - Current tool for rendering more matches is fairly weak and want to rebuild.
 - Flesh out match page more in depth and take more advantage of the statistics returned by Riot API.
